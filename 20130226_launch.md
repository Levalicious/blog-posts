There you go! After years of good intentions I've finally found the time to launch my own development tech blog. I will mainly blog about my findings in the field of C/C++, graphics programming and Qt, often related to code I write for the [demoscene](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demoscene). Have fun!
