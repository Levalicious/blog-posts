In the following you can find the source code of many implementations accompanying my blog posts. Beyond that, I uploaded my bachelor and master thesis. In one or another blog post I might write about things which are explained in more detail in one of the two theses.

# Theses
* [Master thesis](http://geidav.files.wordpress.com/2013/04/mscthesis.pdf) (2012): *Development and evaluation of a real-time capable multiple hypothesis tracker*
* [Bachelor thesis](http://geidav.files.wordpress.com/2013/04/bscthesis.pdf) (2009): *Reconstruction of depth information from images for visualization of architectural models*

# Source code

* [Computing OMBBs in 2D](https://github.com/geidav/ombb-rotating-calipers): Implementation of the Rotating Calipers method for computing oriented minimum bounding boxes as described in this [blog post](http://geidav.wordpress.com/2014/01/23/computing-oriented-minimum-bounding-boxes-in-2d/).
