At [Revision 2013](http://2013.revision-party.net), which was held during Easter, we won the the first place in the 64k intro competition with our newest production [*Turtles all the way down*](http://pouet.net/prod.php?which=61204). You can download the [demo tool](http://www.braincontrol.org/enigma.php) which was used to create this intro with full source-code. In the following days I am going to publish a making-of, giving a lot of insights of the creation process.
