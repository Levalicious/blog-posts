At the *C++ User Group Berlin* meeting this May, Eivind Liland and I gave a talk about the usage of C++ in the demoscene. Below is the abstract of the talk. The slides can be found in the [downloads](http://geidav.wordpress.com/downloads/) section.

>*Eivind and David are demosceners since decades. In this talk they're going to show you two of their award-winning, real-time graphics demos, both highly optimized for different limitations and platforms, and both written in C++.*

>*Turtles all the Way Down by Brain Control (2013) is a 64k-intro for the PC. It's an almost 5 minutes long audio-visual journey using cutting edge algorithms in the areas of computer graphics, generative art and music synthesis. Being a 64k-intro, all textures, 3D objects and music fit into a single executable of merely 65.536 bytes.  
Matt Current by Shitfaced Clowns (2007) is a demo for the Gameboy Advance. It features at that time never-seen-before graphics effects and a software-rendered 3d engine that pushes the device's hardware to their limits. One prevailing opinion is that only by coding in 100% assembly one can push such platforms beyond their limits. Eivind will explain how they used C++ to carefully squeeze the maximum out of every cycle of the GBA's 16 MHz CPU.*

>*Though seemingly esoteric, all the techniques employed to realize these demos have their application in professional software development nowadays. In times of GHz multi-core processors, GPUs and terabyte hard-drives, performance critical code and compact code for embedded and mobile platforms still plays an important role. Eivind and David are going to guide you through the process of creating these graphics demos. They talk about the used algorithms and tools keeping the focus of how C++ was used to do the job.*
